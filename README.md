While applying for jobs, it is quite time-consuming to prepare cover letters for all the job positions. Manually updating the cover letters can be prone to typo and formatting errors. A small mistake such as wrong company name could result in an automatic dismissal in the application process.

The best solution is to automate the routine of replacing text in the cover letter template while keeping the personalization. 

This script helps you automate writing and managing cover letters. It collects all varied text from a CSV table and creates personalized ready-to-go cover letters in seconds.
